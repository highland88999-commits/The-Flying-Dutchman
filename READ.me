# 🏴‍☠️ THE DUTCHMAN | Nexus Terminal v2.6

A cinematic, multi-stage web experience blending high-octane maritime visuals with a futuristic "Artemis-style" glass interface. This project is designed to capture interest for a vehicle-based advertising network.

## 🌌 The Experience Flow

The application utilizes a **Three-Stage Initialization** sequence to bypass browser autoplay restrictions and maximize user engagement:

1.  **Stage 1: The Entry Curtain**
    - A minimalist black "handshake" screen.
    - **Purpose:** Secures user interaction to enable audio and high-performance video rendering.
2.  **Stage 2: The Battle (Landing Stage)**
    - Powered by the YouTube IFrame API.
    - Features the "Black Pearl vs. Flying Dutchman" cinematic.
    - **Purpose:** Establishes the brand's "Dutchman" identity and high-energy hook.
3.  **Stage 3: The Command Center (Main UI)**
    - Fades into a 3D WebGL "Abyss" environment (Three.js).
    - Features a dual-mode console for **Drivers** and **Advertisers**.
    - Includes slow-scroll readability (45s cycle) and glass-morphism UI.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

* **Engine:** [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) (R128) for the 3D Abyss background.
* **Video:** YouTube IFrame API for the cinematic landing sequence.
* **UI:** CSS Glass-morphism with `backdrop-filter` and CSS Keyframe animations for the "Retro-Future" scroll.
* **Logic:** Vanilla JavaScript for state management and scene transitions.

## ⚙️ Configuration

To modify the content or behavior, locate the following constants in the `<script>` section:

| Variable | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `SCENE_3_DURATION` | Controls how long the text stays visible before looping (default: 47s). |
| `videoId` | Swap out `PEaZ5XUe0Mk` to change the cinematic battle video. |
| `line-height` | Adjusted to `1.3` in CSS to keep text blocks compact and readable. |

## 🚀 Deployment

1.  **Host the File:** This is a single-file solution (`index.html`).
2.  **Permissions:** Ensure the site is served over `HTTPS` to allow the YouTube API and Three.js to initialize correctly on mobile devices.
3.  **Mobile Ready:** The viewport is locked to prevent accidental zooming during the scrolling sequence.
